                    <p><strong>Team Collaboration and Strategy</strong><br>
                   This week was very productive for the PharmaStock team. We held a meeting to discuss our individual tasks and make sure everyone was moving in the right direction. During this meeting, we talked about what we wanted to accomplish by the end of the week. It is important to stay organized so that no part of the project is forgotten. By checking in with each other, we made sure that our team is working as a single unit rather than separate parts.</p>
                
                    <p><strong>Improving the Software Design Document</strong><br>
                    My main responsibility this week was to finish the <span class="highlight">Software Design Document (SDD)</span>. To do this correctly, I carefully reviewed the feedback we received from our teacher. Taking advice from experts is a key part of the design process because it helps us find mistakes before they become big problems. I used those suggestions to update our plan and make it even stronger. The SDD is now complete, and it explains exactly how the code and the data for PharmaStock will work together.</p>
                
                    <p><strong>Setting the Foundation</strong><br>
                    With the design document finished, we are now one step closer to setting the foundation for the entire project. In software development, the foundation is the most important part. If the plan is weak, the software will not work well. However, because we took the time to listen to feedback and organize our thoughts, I feel very confident in our progress. We are building a professional tool that will help pharmacies manage their medicine stock more efficiently, and our roadmap is now very clear.</p>

                    <p><strong>Looking Ahead</strong><br>
                    Now that the planning phase is wrapping up, I am excited to see how our ideas turn into real code. This week proved that communication and a willingness to improve are the keys to success. I look forward to sharing more updates as we move into the next phase of development.</p>

                    <p><strong>Getting Started</strong><br>
                   This week marks the official start of my work on the PharmaStock project. The most important event of the week was our first team meeting. My teammates and I met up to get to know each other and begin our collaboration. It was a great opportunity to get acquainted and discuss how we will work together over the next few months. We are all excited to begin this process and have started to build a strong working relationship.</p>
                
                    <p><strong>Software Design and Documentation</strong><br>
                    A major part of my week was spent helping to create our Software Design Document (SDD). This document is a critical piece of the project because it serves as a roadmap for everything we build. It explains how the software will be structured and how different parts of the application will communicate with each other. By completing this document now, we have a clear guide that will help us avoid mistakes and stay organized as the project becomes more complex.</p>
                
                    <p><strong>Visual Identity and Tech Stack</strong><br>
                    While I focused on the design document, my teammate Eric led the creation of our Style Tile. This document is very helpful because it represents the overall look and feel of our application. It includes our color choices, fonts, and the general design theme. Having this finished helps us visualize the final product. Additionally, we have officially set our tech stack in stone. We have a clear plan for the programming languages and tools we will use to build PharmaStock, and the vision for the project is truly coming together.</p>
                
                    <p><strong>Project Style Tile</strong><br>
                    Below is the Style Tile we created to define the look and feel of our application:
