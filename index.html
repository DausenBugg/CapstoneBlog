                <div class="post-content">
                    <p><strong>Completing Our First Sprint</strong><br>
                    I am very happy to share that my team and I have officially finished our first "sprint." In the world of software development, a sprint is a set amount of time where a team works hard to finish specific goals. Completing this first sprint is a huge win for us because it shows that our team is working well together and staying on schedule. We have moved past the planning phase and are now seeing the actual structure of PharmaStock come to life.</p>
                
                    <p><strong>Wiring the Application Together</strong><br>
                    The biggest technical accomplishment this week was "connecting the dots" between the different parts of our app. We successfully connected our MySQL database to our backend code. After that, we connected the backend to the frontend. You can think of this like wiring a house for electricity. The backend is the power station, the database is the fuel, and the frontend is the light switch the user actually touches. Now that these are all linked, data can flow smoothly through the entire system.</p>
                
                    <p><strong>Finalizing the Folder Architecture</strong><br>
                    Another important task we finished was setting our "folder architecture" in stone. When building a large application, it is very easy for files to get messy. By deciding exactly where every piece of code should live right now, we are preventing confusion in the future. This organized foundation means that as the project grows, any team member can easily find the file they need to work on. Our code foundation is now solid and ready for the next level of building.</p>

                    <p><strong>Looking Ahead</strong><br>
                    Next week, we will finally begin implementing user features! This includes building the registration and login pages so users can create accounts. We will also be setting up more specific tables in our database to store all the pharmaceutical data we need.</p>

                <h2 class="post-title">Project Update: Moving into the Development Phase</h2>
                
                <div class="post-content">
                    <p><strong>Organization and Team Sprints</strong><br>
                    This week was a major turning point for the PharmaStock project as we moved from the planning phase into actual development. To keep our work organized, my team and I set up a Jira board. For those who may not know, Jira is a tool used by professional software engineers to track their progress and assign tasks. Along with the board, we started our very first "sprint." A sprint is a short period of time where we focus on finishing specific goals. This helps us stay on schedule and ensures that everyone knows exactly what they need to do.</p>
                
                    <p><strong>Visualizing the App</strong><br>
                    While we were setting up our organization tools, my teammates focused on creating a wireframe prototype. This is essentially a basic drawing or a blueprint of what the app will look like on the screen. It doesn't have all the final colors or images yet, but it shows where the buttons and menus will go. This is a very important step because it allows us to test how a user will move through the app before we spend a lot of time writing the visual code.</p>
                
                    <p><strong>Building the Technical Foundation</strong><br>
                    My main task this week was focused on the back-end of the application. I started a new ASP.NET Web API project to serve as the foundation for PharmaStock. You can think of the API as the "engine" of the app. It is the part that sits behind the scenes and handles all the data and logic. By setting this up now, I am creating a solid base that will allow our app to talk to databases and process information quickly and safely. It was exciting to see the project officially take shape in a real coding environment.</p>

                    <p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br>
                    We have made a lot of progress this week by combining strong organization with technical setup. Between the Jira board, the wireframes, and the new API project, the foundation for PharmaStock is stronger than ever. I am looking forward to seeing how these pieces come together in the coming weeks.</p>

                    <p><strong>Team Collaboration and Strategy</strong><br>
                   This week was very productive for the PharmaStock team. We held a meeting to discuss our individual tasks and make sure everyone was moving in the right direction. During this meeting, we talked about what we wanted to accomplish by the end of the week. It is important to stay organized so that no part of the project is forgotten. By checking in with each other, we made sure that our team is working as a single unit rather than separate parts.</p>
                
                    <p><strong>Improving the Software Design Document</strong><br>
                    My main responsibility this week was to finish the <span class="highlight">Software Design Document (SDD)</span>. To do this correctly, I carefully reviewed the feedback we received from our teacher. Taking advice from experts is a key part of the design process because it helps us find mistakes before they become big problems. I used those suggestions to update our plan and make it even stronger. The SDD is now complete, and it explains exactly how the code and the data for PharmaStock will work together.</p>
                
                    <p><strong>Setting the Foundation</strong><br>
                    With the design document finished, we are now one step closer to setting the foundation for the entire project. In software development, the foundation is the most important part. If the plan is weak, the software will not work well. However, because we took the time to listen to feedback and organize our thoughts, I feel very confident in our progress. We are building a professional tool that will help pharmacies manage their medicine stock more efficiently, and our roadmap is now very clear.</p>

                    <p><strong>Looking Ahead</strong><br>
                    Now that the planning phase is wrapping up, I am excited to see how our ideas turn into real code. This week proved that communication and a willingness to improve are the keys to success. I look forward to sharing more updates as we move into the next phase of development.</p>

                    <p><strong>Getting Started</strong><br>
                   This week marks the official start of my work on the PharmaStock project. The most important event of the week was our first team meeting. My teammates and I met up to get to know each other and begin our collaboration. It was a great opportunity to get acquainted and discuss how we will work together over the next few months. We are all excited to begin this process and have started to build a strong working relationship.</p>
                
                    <p><strong>Software Design and Documentation</strong><br>
                    A major part of my week was spent helping to create our Software Design Document (SDD). This document is a critical piece of the project because it serves as a roadmap for everything we build. It explains how the software will be structured and how different parts of the application will communicate with each other. By completing this document now, we have a clear guide that will help us avoid mistakes and stay organized as the project becomes more complex.</p>
                
                    <p><strong>Visual Identity and Tech Stack</strong><br>
                    While I focused on the design document, my teammate Eric led the creation of our Style Tile. This document is very helpful because it represents the overall look and feel of our application. It includes our color choices, fonts, and the general design theme. Having this finished helps us visualize the final product. Additionally, we have officially set our tech stack in stone. We have a clear plan for the programming languages and tools we will use to build PharmaStock, and the vision for the project is truly coming together.</p>
                
                    <p><strong>Project Style Tile</strong><br>
                    Below is the Style Tile we created to define the look and feel of our application:
